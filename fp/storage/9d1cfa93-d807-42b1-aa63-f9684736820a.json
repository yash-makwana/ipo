However, the allocation details on Page 57 and 321 describe allocation structures that are more characteristic of a fixed price or non-book-built issue. Specifically, Page 57 mentions allocation on a 'proportionate basis' to Non-Institutional Bidders and Individual Investors, and Page 321 states that allotment to Bidders other than Individual Investors and Anchor Investors 'may be on proportionate basis'. The legal requirement pertains to 'an issue made other than through the book building process'. Since the DRHP simultaneously suggests a book-building process and describes allocation methods that could apply to a non-book-built issue, it is unclear which process is actually being followed. Therefore, it is impossible to definitively assess compliance with the legal requirement for issues made *other than* through the book building process.",
