While the DRHP provides revenue percentages from institutional and government customers on pages 6, 7, and 10 (e.g., \"19.04%\", \"11.14%\", \"0.00%\"), it does not detail the specific terms under which these instruments, if any, are convertible or exchangeable. Furthermore, there are cross-page issues related to AMOUNT_CONFLICT on pages 9 and 9, which may be linked to these unstated conversion terms.\n\nRecommendation: Kindly provide the complete terms of conversion or exchange for all relevant instruments.\n\nRegulation Ref: SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2018\n\nCritical: Page 6",
